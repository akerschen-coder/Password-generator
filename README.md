# Password-generator
## Criteria that had to be met 
- Must meet all criteria that user put in including: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special symbols
- Able to take in all requests and compute a password 
- Alerts user if password is too short or long 
- Must have alert when password is too short or too long 

## Purpose 
The purpose of making this was to experiment and play around with how javascript works in arrays, loops and functions to create a random password generator. 

## Improvement 
Places that I could've improved if given more time would be to make the functions of the random charcters into variables and add .split() and switch the if statements to functions that would .concat to add to the end of the given password. I will probably do this project again to solify my understanding.
